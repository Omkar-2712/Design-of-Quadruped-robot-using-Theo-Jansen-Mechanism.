Legged robots are a type of mobile robot which use mechanical arm for movement. These robots are more versatile than wheeled robots. It is known that animals can travel over rough surface at speeds much greater than wheeled or tracked vehicles. Wheeled vehicles are not suitable for rough surface due to some reasons. 
It is also practically impossible for most automobiles to move over vertical surfaces. Even on very sandy and circular edge surfaces most automobiles slip frequently. The facts are that, there is still a lot of scope left for changing the way.
